                    <p class="white-text text-darken-1 flow-text">Phamerator is the comparative bacteriophage genomics platform for the
                        <a class="blue-text text-lighten-3" href="https://seaphages.org" target="_blank">SEA-PHAGES</a> program.
                        Bacteriophages are genetically diverse and incredibly numerous. Current estimates suggest there are about 1 billion times as many bacteriophages on planet Earth
                        as there are stars in the universe!

                        Nearly all of the genome sequences and annotations in our database are the product of a decade's hard work performed by the SEA-PHAGES students, faculty, and teaching assistants.
                        We developed Phamerator to help them discover and share the story of their phages.
